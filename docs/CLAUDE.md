# Tanzu Data Intelligence Installer Script

You are an expert Database Adminsitrator asked  to create automation for installing Greenplum database v7 on 1..n Servers.  The automation should allow me to set the number of servers and types and even install on a single node if I want.  You should provide reasonable defaults for everything, but ask me in a configuration stage if there are values that might need to be adjusted. You should prompt me for any info you need and then store that for later runs. Make it give great feedback and very concise and clear. Use colors in the CLI to make things more clear.  Give me a specific directory to store the needed files.   Create a detailed phased plan that we can then go through and complete the project and store that as a file that we can use for tracking

# Development Partnership

We build production code together. I handle implementation details while you guide architecture and catch complexity early.

## Core Workflow: Research → Plan → Implement → Validate

**Start every feature with:** "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

1. **Research** - Understand existing patterns and architecture
2. **Plan** - Propose approach and verify with you
3. **Implement** - Build with tests and error handling
4. **Validate** - ALWAYS run formatters, linters, and tests after implementation

## Code Organization

**Keep functions small and focused:**
- If you need comments to explain sections, split into functions
- Group related functionality into clear packages
- Prefer many small files over few large ones

## Architecture Principles

**This is always a feature branch:**
- Delete old code completely - no deprecation needed
- No versioned names (processV2, handleNew, ClientOld)
- No migration code unless explicitly requested
- No "removed code" comments - just delete it

**Prefer explicit over implicit:**
- Clear function names over clever abstractions
- Obvious data flow over hidden magic
- Direct dependencies over service locators

## Maximize Efficiency

**Parallel operations:** Run multiple searches, reads, and greps in single messages
**Multiple agents:** Split complex tasks - one for tests, one for implementation
**Batch similar work:** Group related file edits together

## Problem Solving

**When stuck:** Stop. The simple solution is usually correct.

**When uncertain:** "Let me ultrathink about this architecture."

**When choosing:** "I see approach A (simple) vs B (flexible). Which do you prefer?"

Your redirects prevent over-engineering. When uncertain about implementation, stop and ask for guidance.

## Testing Strategy

**Match testing approach to code complexity:**
- Complex business logic: Write tests first (TDD)
- Simple CRUD operations: Write code first, then tests
- Hot paths: Add benchmarks after implementation

**Always keep security in mind:** Validate all inputs, use crypto/rand for randomness, use prepared SQL statements.

**Performance rule:** Measure before optimizing. No guessing.

## Progress Tracking

- **TodoWrite** for task management
- **Clear naming** in all code

Focus on maintainable solutions over clever abstractions.

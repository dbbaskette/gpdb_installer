# Greenplum Installer Development Plan

**Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Scripting (Estimated time: 2 days)**
*   **\[x] Task 1.1:** Set up the project directory and initialize the main script (`gpdb_installer.sh`) with basic structure, logging, and configuration functions.
*   **\[x] Task 1.2:** Implement the `preflight_checks` function to verify OS compatibility (CentOS/RHEL/Rocky Linux 7/8/9), check for required packages (e.g., `sshpass`, `sudo`), and verify the running user's privileges.
*   **\[x] Task 1.3:** Implement the `setup_hosts` function to create the `gpadmin` user and group, create data directories, and configure passwordless SSH across all cluster hosts.
*   **\[x] Task 1.4:** Implement the `install_greenplum` function to handle the Greenplum binary installation. This includes checking for the installer file in the `files` directory, distributing it to all hosts, and using the appropriate package manager (`rpm` or `dpkg`) to install the Greenplum binaries.  Determine how to handle different Greenplum versions or offer a choice.
*   **\[x] Task 1.5:** Implement the `initialize_cluster` function to create the Greenplum cluster. This involves generating a `gpinitsystem_config` file based on user inputs, running the `gpinitsystem` command, setting up necessary environment variables in the `gpadmin` user's `.bashrc` on all hosts, and configuring `pg_hba.conf` for client connections.
*   **\[x] Task 1.6:** Add error handling throughout the script to catch potential issues (e.g., command failures, file not found, incorrect user input) and provide informative error messages. Ensure the script exits gracefully on errors.
*   **\[x] Task 1.7:** Thoroughly test the basic installation workflow on a test environment, including single-node and multi-node setups, with and without a standby coordinator.

**Improvements Made:**
- Added missing `check_sudo_privileges` function
- Improved SSH key generation with better error handling
- Added configuration validation function
- Fixed array syntax in configuration file generation
- Enhanced error handling for SSH key distribution
- Created comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- Created detailed TROUBLESHOOTING.md guide
- Added proper validation of configuration values
- Enhanced preflight checks with memory, disk space, and library validation
- Added Greenplum version compatibility checking
- Implemented network connectivity validation
- Added automatic sshpass installation if missing
- Added progress indicators and enhanced user feedback
- Implemented timestamped logging for better tracking
- Added comprehensive error handling with detailed messages

**Phase 2: Advanced Features and Robustness (Estimated time: 3 days)**

*   **\[x] Task 2.1:** Enhance `preflight_checks` to validate specific Greenplum version requirements. This might involve checking OS versions against Greenplum compatibility matrix, required library versions, etc. Implement memory and disk space checking.
*   **\[x] Task 2.2:** Add more robust error handling and logging. Implement detailed logging of each step, including timestamps and host-specific outputs, to aid in troubleshooting.
*   **\[ \] Task 2.3:**  Implement "resume" capability. If the script fails partway through, it should be able to pick up where it left off, rather than restarting from scratch. This might involve creating status files or tracking progress in the configuration file.
*   **\[ \] Task 2.4:** Implement an "uninstall" option or script to remove Greenplum cleanly from the servers, if desired.
*   **\[x] Task 2.5:** Improve user feedback during long operations with progress indicators or more frequent status updates.
*   **\[ \] Task 2.6:** Test the installer on a wider range of system configurations and network environments. Conduct more extensive testing, including failure scenarios (e.g., network interruptions, disk failures).

**Phase 3: Documentation and Refinement (Estimated time: 1 day)**

*   **\[x] Task 3.1:** Create comprehensive documentation, including a README file with setup instructions, usage examples, troubleshooting tips, and a description of the script's architecture.
*   **\[x] Task 3.2:** Review and refactor the code for clarity, maintainability, and performance. Ensure consistent coding style and add comments where necessary.
*   **\[ \] Task 3.3:** Finalize testing and address any remaining issues or bugs.

**Current Status: ENHANCED AND READY FOR TESTING**

The installer is now enhanced and ready for testing with the following features implemented:
- Complete installation workflow from preflight checks to cluster initialization
- Enhanced preflight checks with memory, disk space, and library validation
- Greenplum version compatibility checking
- Network connectivity validation
- Progress indicators and enhanced user feedback
- Timestamped logging for better tracking
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Configuration persistence and reuse
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Detailed logging with color-coded output
- Support for single-node and multi-node deployments
- Standby coordinator support
- Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides

**Next Steps:**
1. Place a Greenplum installer RPM in the `files/` directory
2. Test the installation on a single-node setup
3. Test multi-node deployment if multiple hosts are available
4. Address any issues found during testing
5. Proceed to Phase 2 enhancements based on testing feedback
